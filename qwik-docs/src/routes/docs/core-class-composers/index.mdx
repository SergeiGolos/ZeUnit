# Class Composers

For a test to execute, a class needs to exist.  Before the class exists, the dependencies also need to exist, and `ZeClassComposer` is how it handles getting the dependencies.  When a `Fact` is discovered, ZeUnit looks at the class type and identifies the lifecycle. Based on that lifecycle, it creates a class factory that the test runner can call to get a test class.  When that test class has dependencies, `ZeClassComposer` classes become the sources for those dependencies.  


The default lifecycles are inherited from:

- `TransientSuite` - The default class lifecycle that is automatically applied to test classes which inherit from a `Suite` class
- `ReEntrySuite` -  Singleton lifecycle for the test class and as a result may require some tests to execute before others allowing the suite to be its own state machine
