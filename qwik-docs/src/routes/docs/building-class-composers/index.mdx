# Building Class Composers

<Warning title="Under Construction" >
    This page is under construction and may contain incomplete or incorrect information.

Looking over in the demo project, this example can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/bitcobblers/ZeUnit/blob/main/ZeUnit.Demo/Fakes/FakeTests.cs" target="_blank">FakeTests</a>

```csharp
public interface IFakeService
{
    int GetOne();
}

[Fakes]
public class FakeTests(Fake<IFakeService> fake) 
{       
    public Fact FakeIsReturnsTheValue()
    {
        fake.CallsTo(x => x.GetOne())
            .Returns(1);

        return fake.FakedObject.GetOne() == 1;
    }
}
```

What actually happens behind the scence is the implementation of two types:

- A `ZeComposerAttribute` generic implementation that points to an instance of a `IZeClassComposer` class.
- The `IZeClassComposer` implementation defined by the `ZeComposerAttribute` which knows how to take data from the `ZeComposerAttribute` and create the types the class is dependent on.

A natural implementation includes the `LamarContainerAttribute` or the `FakesAttribute` this article digs into.

## Building the Composer

For ZeUnit to know how to populate the dependencies of a test class it will look to a collection of `IZeClassComposer` instances, asking each of the composers for the classes it needs and doing its best to compose from all the response.  Here is the `FakesClassComposer`

```csharp
public class FakesClassComposer : IZeClassComposer    
{
    protected Dictionary<Type, Func<object>> factory = new Dictionary<Type, Func<object>>();

    public object? Get(Type args)
    {
        var genericType = args.GetGenericArguments().FirstOrDefault();
        if (genericType == null || !args.FullName.StartsWith("FakeItEasy.Fake"))
        {
            return default;
        }
        if (!factory.ContainsKey(genericType)) 
        {
            Type fakeType = typeof(Fake<>).MakeGenericType(new Type[] { genericType });
            factory.Add(genericType, () => Activator.CreateInstance(fakeType)!);            
        }        

        return factory[genericType]();
    }    
}
```

Part of the big function here is that the `IZeClassComposer` interface returns the `Nullable<object>` from the get call, allowing a composer to fail to return a type.

In this case, we are not really interested in any information as this `IZeClassComposer` is generic looking at the `Type args` to both be a generic argument and to be of a type `FakeItEasy.Fake`.  And knowing that if we request that type we should make the generic version of `new Fake<TType>()` something that we do caching the reflection call to the activator into a function.

## The Composer Attribute

And the easy part, just creating the marker attribute that lets ZeUnit know that the `FakesClassComposer` is used by the test class.

```csharp
public class FakesAttribute : ZeComposerAttribute<FakesClassComposer> 
{
}
```

## Breaking the Test Mold

The traditional thinking about tests has some purity standards that in the case of this type of work is really breaking the mold.  Test dependencies are the responsiblity of `// Assemble` but ZeUnit has done away with the traditional view of `//Assert` and these composer methods are a re-usable method of sharing the `//Assemble` part of your class.

Do you have a repeating pattern of how you build your fakes?  Get it directly inject with a `IZeClassComposer` class and a quick `ZeComposerAttribute` marker class and all your tests objects and fakes they need.
