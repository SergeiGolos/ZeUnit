## Functional Approach to Tests


<Warning title="Under Construction" >
    This page is under construction and may contain incomplete or incorrect information.
</Warning>

Developers familiar with existing testing frameworks like XUnit and NUnit will notices some key differences:

 - The familiar `Assert` has been replaced by `new Fact()` or a collection of `Shouldly` style assertion helpers
 - Test methods return `Fact` in the case of single synchronous test result and `Task<Fact>` when the single result is asynchronous

ZeUnit borrows a lot from functional programming, and requires that functions return results. In our case the `Fact` object which can have 0 or more assertions like `Equal` or `Type` in the code example above.   Labeling the test function with a resulting type as defined in the table below allows you to define the execution timeline of your test(s) and how the `Fact` object(s) is/are being returned.

|  Test Results   | **One**          |  **Many**               |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Now**         | `Fact`       | `IEnumerable<Fact>` |
| **Later**       | `Task<Fact>` | `IObservable<Fact>` |
