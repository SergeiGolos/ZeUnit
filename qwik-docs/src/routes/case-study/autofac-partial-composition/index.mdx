## Painting the Scene

[Autofac](https://autofac.org/) is a popular dependency injection framework for .NET and you are building an application .  It is a mature and feature rich framework that is widely used in the .NET community.  It is a popular choice for dependency injection in .NET Core and .NET Framework applications.

Adding these behaviors will require additional packages to be added to your project:

```
Install-Package ZeUnit.FakeItEasy
Install-Package ZeUnit.Autofac
```

# The Contrived Example

Examples of frameworks are often a bit contorted to show off the framework while making a mockery of the testing framework it self.  

```csharp
[Fakes]
[AutofacModule<SimpleServiceInjectionModule>()]
public class AutofacInjectionZeTestClass(
    Func<ISimpleInjectedDependency, ISimpleInjectedService> factory, 
    Fake<ISimpleInjectedDependency> fake)
{    
    public Fact ConstructorInjectionTestMethodThatPasses()
    {
        fake.CallsTo(n => n.Value()).Returns("Fake");
        var instance = factory(fake.FakedObject);

        return instance.Test() == "Fake";
    }
}
```
