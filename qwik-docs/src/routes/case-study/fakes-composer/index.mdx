# Fakes Composer

Looking over in the demo project, this example can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/bitcobblers/ZeUnit/blob/main/ZeUnit.Demo/Fakes/FakeTests.cs" target="_blank">FakeTests</a>

```csharp
public interface IFakeService
{
    int GetOne();
}

[Fakes]
public class FakeTests(Fake<IFakeService> fake) 
{       
    public Fact FakeIsReturnsTheValue()
    {
        fake.CallsTo(x => x.GetOne())
            .Returns(1);

        return fake.FakedObject.GetOne() == 1;
    }
}
```

What actually happens behind the scence is the implementation of two types:

- A `ZeComposerAttribute` generic implementation that points to an instance of a `IZeClassComposer` class.
- The `IZeClassComposer` implementation defined by the `ZeComposerAttribute` which knows how to take data from the `ZeComposerAttribute` and create the types the class is dependent on.

A natural implementation includes the `LamarContainerAttribute` or the `FakesAttribute` this article digs into.

## Building the Composer

For ZeUnit to know how to populate the dependencies of a test class it will look to a collection of `IZeClassComposer` instances, asking each of the composers for the classes it needs and doing its best to compose from all the response.  Here is the `FakesClassComposer`

```csharp
public class FakesClassComposer : IZeClassComposer    
{
    protected Dictionary<Type, Func<object>> factory = new Dictionary<Type, Func<object>>();

    public object? Get(Type args)
    {
        var genericType = args.GetGenericArguments().FirstOrDefault();
        if (genericType == null || !args.FullName.StartsWith("FakeItEasy.Fake"))
        {
            return default;
        }
        if (!factory.ContainsKey(genericType)) 
        {
            Type fakeType = typeof(Fake<>).MakeGenericType(new Type[] { genericType });
            factory.Add(genericType, () => Activator.CreateInstance(fakeType)!);            
        }        

        return factory[genericType]();
    }    
}
```

Part of the big function here is that the `IZeClassComposer` interface returns the `Nullable<object>` from the get call, allowing a composer to fail to return a type.

In this case, we are not really interested in any information as this `IZeClassComposer` is generic looking at the `Type args` to both be a generic argument and to be of a type `FakeItEasy.Fake`.  And knowing that if we request that type we should make the generic version of `new Fake<TType>()` something that we do caching the reflection call to the activator into a function.

## The Composer Attribute

And the easy part, just creating the marker attribute that lets ZeUnit know that the `FakesClassComposer` is used by the test class.  This can be thought of as the arguments for the constructor, in the case of our `FakesClassComposer` it has no arguments but other classes might.

```csharp
public class FakesAttribute : ZeComposerAttribute<FakesClassComposer> 
{
}
```

A generic and none-reflection version of the same type of class also exists in the form of `FakeAttribute<TType>` which informs composer composer class also keyed to the `TType` generic to only create the `Fake<TType>` when the args request the specific `TType` type.

```csharp
public class FakeAttribute<TType> 
    : ZeComposerAttribute<FakeClassComposer<TType>>
    where TType : class
{
}
```
