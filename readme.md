### ZeUnit - take the reins of your testing framework.

How Google Tests Software (link to the book) talks about a system of test clasification that doesn't neatly fit into the bucket of unit or integration testing and instead classifies them as small, medium or large.  But the duality of testing frameworks seem to push you into a binary choice. 

* **Unit Testing** - in dotnet, this would be XUnit or NUnit, both of which focus on small scale testing and don't come with tools that enable contextual state.  The dogma that comes with using these framework chastises the use of classes that set up state, preaching a pure test instantiating all of it's scope.
* **Integration Testing** - these would be your SpecFlow, Fitnesse and StoryTeller.  At the abstract layer, these frameworks enable some kind of system state abstracted behind a fixture.  But with the tendency of these languages to use runtime test interpreters, writing low level integration tests is not really practical.

ZeUnit aims to fit as a bridge between these two worlds, allowing developer centric unit and integration testing to be written with one framework and with out the necessary ceremony of creating wiki file bindings.  

## What gives ZeUnit its power?

ZeUnit was conceived as am idea for preloading state into XUnit because when a colleague asked for an Integration Testing framework recommendation, I couldn't give him one.  This led me down a rabbit hole of looking at XUnit code, and after some thinking I had an answer to my integration testing framework.  What if we give Test classes dependency injection?

Several iterations later, this has turned into a framework that supports a testing based set of custom class and method activators, that allow context to be created for the execution of a tests.  One example of this would be the Lamar container class that allows a user to re-user their *ServiceRegistry* classes to populate a container that creates the test class instance.

```
[LamarContainer(typeof(SimpleServiceInjectionRegistry))]
public class InjectionZeUnitClass
{
    private readonly ISimpleInjectedService service;

    public InjectionZeTestClass(ISimpleInjectedService service)
    {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public ZeResult ConstructorInjectionTestMethodThatPasses()
    {
        return Ze.Assert()  
            .IsNotNull(this.service);

    }
}
```

Behind the scenes, the *SimpleServiceInjectorRegistraty* that is passed into the *LamarContainerAttribute* creates the container registration for *ISimpleInjectedService* with some implementation. When the testing framework calls the Activator defined in the *LamarContainerAttribute*, it creates the instance of the class.

At the same time, there is nothing that prevents the test from being as simple as an XUnit/NUnit test is today. A test requires no additional context to exist before it is run.

```
public class SampleZeUnitClass
{
    public ZeResult SimpleTestMethodThatPasses() 
    {            
        var result = 2 + 2;
        return Ze.Assert()
            .IsType<int>(result)
            .IsEqual(4, result);
    }

    public ZeResult SimpleTestMethodThatFailes()
    {
        var result = 2 + 2;
        return Ze.Assert()            
            .IsEqual(5, result);
    }
}
```

Because the power of the test and method activation is yours, you get to define the scale of each test class with existing or custom *ZeActivationAttributes* and the *ZeActivator* classes. 

### Some basics

* The way you should get data out of a function is by getting its return value. To follow this functional practice ZeUnit does away with static Assert and instead expects that test methods will return their *ZeResult* value(s) instead.
* Because we know the return type of any test will allway be ZeResult, we don't need Attributes to mark methods for extension.  The discovery simply looks at the method return *ZeResult*, *IEnumerable<ZeResult>*, *Task<ZeResult> or IObservable<ZeResult> and registers the methods for testing.
