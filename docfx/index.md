# ZeUnit Testing Framework

At the heart of ZeUnit sits a simple principle, functional programing is cleaner.  
- Tests should be functions.
- Functions should have all the necessary dependencies.
- Functions should return a consistent results

Taking this "pure" function approach to testing allows some interesting windfall effects that can super charge your testing experience.

- Custom test activation
- Different class life-cycles
- Test middleware
